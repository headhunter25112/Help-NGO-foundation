# Clustering Countries Based on Socio-Economic Factors 🌍  

## Overview  
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to cluster countries based on **socio-economic indicators** such as GDP, literacy rate, healthcare accessibility, and more. The model helps policymakers, NGOs, and researchers gain insights into country segments to drive **data-driven decision-making** for global development strategies.  

## Features  
✅ Data collection and preprocessing of structured socio-economic datasets  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) to identify key economic and social patterns  
✅ **K-Means Clustering** to segment countries based on key indicators  
✅ **Visualization dashboards using Tableau and Power BI**  
✅ **Deployment of an interactive web app using Streamlit** for real-time analysis  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (K-Means Clustering)  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit
